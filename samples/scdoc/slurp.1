.SH NAME
.PP
slurp - select a region in a Wayland compositor
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fIslurp\fR [options.\&.\&.\&]
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
slurp is a command-line utility to select a region from Wayland compositors
which support the layer-shell protocol.\& It lets the user hold the pointer to
select, or click to cancel the selection.\&
.PP
If the standard input is not a TTY or the -r option is used, slurp will read a
list of predefined rectangles for quick selection.\& Each line must be in the form
"<x>,<y> <width>x<height> [label]".\& The label is optional and can be any string
that doesn'\&t contain newlines.\& It can be accessed using the "%l" sequence in a
format string.\&
.PP
If the \fIEsc\fR key is pressed, selection is cancelled.\& If the \fISpace\fR key is
held, the selection is moved instead of being resized.\&
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fI-h\fR
Show help message and quit.\&
.PP
\fI-d\fR
Display dimensions of selection.\&
.PP
\fI-b\fR \fIcolor\fR
Set background color.\& See \fICOLORS\fR for more detail.\&
.PP
\fI-c\fR \fIcolor\fR
Set border color.\& See \fICOLORS\fR for more detail.\&
.PP
\fI-s\fR \fIcolor\fR
Set selection color.\& See \fICOLORS\fR for more detail.\&
.PP
\fI-B\fR \fIcolor\fR
Set color for highlighting predefined rectangles from standard input when not
selected.\&
.PP
\fI-F\fR \fIfont family\fR
Set the font family name when displaying the dimensions box.\& Only useful
when combined with the -d option.\& The available font family names guaranteed
to work are the standard generic CSS2 options: serif, sans-serif,
monospace, cursive and fantasy.\& It defaults to the sans-serif family name.\&
.PP
\fI-w\fR \fIweight\fR
Set border weight.\&
.PP
\fI-f\fR \fIformat\fR
Set format.\& See \fIFORMAT\fR for more detail.\&
.PP
\fI-p\fR
Select a single pixel instead of a rectangle.\& This mode ignores any
predefined rectangles read from the standard input.\&
.PP
\fI-o\fR
Add predefined rectangles for all outputs, as if provided on standard input.\&
The label will be the name of the output.\&
.PP
\fI-r\fR
Require the user to select one of the predefined rectangles.\& These can come
from standard input, if \fI-o\fR is used, the rectangles of all display outputs.\&
This option conflicts with \fI-p\fR.\&
.PP
\fI-a\fR \fIwidth\fR:\fIheight\fR
Force selections to have the given aspect ratio.\& This constraint is not
applied to the predefined rectangles specified using \fI-o\fR.\&
.PP
.SH COLORS
.PP
Colors may be specified in #RRGGBB or #RRGGBBAA format.\& The # is optional.\&
.PP
.SH FORMAT
.PP
Interpreted sequences are:
.PP
%x The x-coordinate of the selection
.PP
%y The y-coordinate of the selection
.PP
%w The width of the selection
.PP
%h The height of the selection
.PP
%X The x-coordinate of the selection with coordinates relative to the output
containing the top left corner.\&
.PP
%Y The y-coordinate of the selection with coordinates relative to the output
containing the top left corner.\&
.PP
%W The width of the selection cropped to the output containing the top left
corner.\&
.PP
%H The height of the selection cropped to the output containing the top left
corner.\&
.PP
%l Label included with region from stdin
.PP
%o The name of the output containing the top left corner, or "<unknown>" if
not known
.PP
The default format is "%x,%y %wx%h\\n".\&
.PP
.SH KEYBOARD CONTROLS
.PP
The following keyboard actions can be used during selection:
.PP
\fIEscape\fR Cancel the selection and exit slurp
.PP
\fISpace\fR If currently making a selection, while space is held down, move the
entire selection rather than change the selection'\&s size as you move the
pointer.\&
.PP
\fIShift\fR Experimental.\& If the \fI-a\fR option wasn'\&t specified, then set the aspect
ratio to 1:1 while shift is held down, releasing it restores the un-constrained
aspect ratio.\& \fINote:\fR This behavior may change in the future depending on
feedback.\&
