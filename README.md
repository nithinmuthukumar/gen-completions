This is an unfinished project to parse manpages to get completions for Zsh, and other shells.
Also generates JSON files, in case your shell isn't supported, so you can process
it and generate completions yourself.

Ported from [Fish's completions script](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/master/share/tools/create_manpage_completions.py)
