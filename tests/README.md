# Tests

In the [`in`](./resources/in) folder are manpages for whom completions will be
generated, as part of the integration tests. The expected outputs will be in the
[`expected`](./resources/expected) folder. The [`tmp`](./resources/tmp) folder
will hold the completions generated by the tests, which will then be compared to
the files in the `expected` folder.
