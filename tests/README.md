# Tests

- In the [`in`](./resources/in) folder are manpages for whom completions will be
  generated, as part of the integration tests.
- The expected outputs will be in the [`expected`](./resources/expected) folder.
- The [`tmp`](./resources/tmp) folder (ignored by git) will hold the completions
  generated by the tests, which will then be compared to the files in the `expected` folder.

To see the log output from tests, use `RUST_LOG=<whatever> cargo test`
